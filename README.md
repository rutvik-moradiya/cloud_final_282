# Project Discription 
The cloud-based project management portal is a modern and scalable web application that will allow teams to collaborate and manage their projects efficiently. The application will be built using MERN stack, which consists of MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. Vite and Chakra UI will be used for a faster and responsive user interface. The application will be hosted on AWS and will be implemented using AWS CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment and testing.

The project management portal will have features such as user authentication, project creation, team management, task management, real-time updates, and data visualization. The application will provide users with a customizable dashboard to track their tasks, deadlines, and progress. The portal will also allow team members to collaborate and communicate effectively through in-app messaging and notifications.

With the help of MERN stack and AWS, the project management portal will be highly scalable and cost-efficient. The application will use serverless architecture, which will enable automatic scaling and will save costs by only charging for the actual usage. The portal will be designed to meet all web standards and best practices, ensuring it is accessible, secure, and mobile-friendly.

Overall, the cloud-based project management portal will be a powerful tool for teams to streamline their workflows, enhance collaboration, and achieve their project goals efficiently.
